# Signal-Core
A cross-language contract powering sovereign agent interaction, intent execution, and feedback tracking. Built for humans. Compatible with bots.

Signal-Core defines a lightweight, interoperable message structure for decentralized systems.
Used across the SovereignTrust protocol and SDAUtilities toolkits, it provides a portable, self-describing container for:

intents (commands, queries, executions)

feedback (warnings, errors, logs)

return values (typed or structured)

mergeable history and lineage tracking

The format is implementation-agnostic and maintained in multiple languages (C#, PowerShell, more at community direction).
It is designed to maximize transparency, verifiability, and system-neutral orchestration in both human-driven and autonomous environments.
